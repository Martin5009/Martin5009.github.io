### Welcome to my page! 

Here I semi-regularly post updates and technical documentation for my personal projects. Most of the projects I post will be electronics related. If you have any questions, comments, or requests, feel free to reach out using my contact info at the bottom of this page.

### Who am I?

I am Martin. One of my main hobbies is designing and building electronics. When I'm not doing that, I might be producing music, playing badminton, tending to my three pet hissing roaches, or working full time as an electrical engineering.
