### Welcome to my page! 

Here I semi-regularly post updates and technical documentation for my personal/class projects. Most of the projects I post will be electronics or engineering related. Navigate to a specific project page using the links at the top of the page. If you have any questions, comments, or file requests, feel free to reach out using my contact info at the bottom of this page.

### Who am I?

I am Martin, a recent electrical engineering graduate and electronics hobbyist. I'm currently seeking entry-level work as an electrical engineer, with the goal of designing application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) after getting some well-needed experience. I've recently picked up designing electronics as a hobby. Right now I'm designing a digital delay pedal for electric guitar using an FPGA, and I'll be posting demo videos here soon, so keep a lookout if you are interested. Outside of electronics work, you may also find me producing music or playing badminton at the local courts.
